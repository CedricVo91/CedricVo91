- 👋 Hi, I’m @CedricVo91
- 👀 I’m interested in quantitative research & development (low-latency systems & backend development in FinTech), (quantitative) problem-solving, data science & machine learning for finance, algorithms & data structures, and FinTech (distributed ledger technologies, cryptocurrency, payment systems, DeFi)
- I can offer skills in data science & machine learning with application to finance and cryptocurrency projects (mainly DeFi) and on-chain data analysis (i.e., ETF of data stored on distributed blockchains, mainly on Ethereum)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematical foundations of machine learning, algorithms & data structures, computational problem solving, and advanced Python (including advanced web scrapping, OOP, and web application frameworks).
- I plan to study computer science principles in C as a precursor to studying C++, learning different programming paradigms, and deepening my understanding of memory management, pointers, and low-level system operations.
- I want to join a high-growth FinTech company as a Python developer, contributing to open-source projects, hackathons, and freelance opportunities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (on-chain) data analysis, algorithm design, and Machine Learning for Finance/FinTech. 
- 📫 How to reach me: just send me a message on cedricvogt91@gmail.com :)
